# AI-DLC Audit Log

## Workspace Detection
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-17T20:08:33.223Z
**User Input**: "I want to build a Flappy Bird clone called Flappy Kiro. Flappy Kiro is an arcade-style game in which the player controls a ghost called Ghosty, which moves persistently to the right. They are tasked with navigating Ghosty through a series of walls that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Ghosty automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the spacebar. Each successful pass through a pair of walls awards the player one point. Colliding with a wall or the ground ends the gameplay.keep it simple"
